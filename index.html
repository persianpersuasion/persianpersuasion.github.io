    <p>
      Founder and Director of a nonprofit SaaS initiative deploying
      Python-based machine learning tools for community organizations
      and local public agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve led cross-functional teams to build end-to-end data pipelines,
      geospatial dashboards, and predictive models that helped
      service organizations identify coverage gaps and optimize outreach.

      At Data Science Alliance, I conducted panel regression analyses
      forecasting homelessness trends across West Coast states and built
      automated dashboards for policy-facing teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also co-authored peer-reviewed research applying predictive analytics
      to healthcare supply chains, achieving substantial cost savings through
      data-driven resource allocation.
